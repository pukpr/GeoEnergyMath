package GEM.LTE.Gravity.Shared is

   -- Record structure used for optimization sharing
   -- This could use the benefit of Ada record representation clauses,
   -- but as it is with GNAT compiler, there is no dope information
   -- and so is essentially a linear array of long_floats

   type Param_S (NLT : Integer) is
      record
         P  : Parms;
         LT : Modulations(1..NLT);
      end record;

   -- don't think this is necessary but watch for cases where the
   -- compiler may optimize away reads and treat the data as unused
   -- pragma Volatile(Param_S);

   --
   -- This is the approach for delivering the input parameters to the
   -- processing threads. The call to Put will release the Get per thread
   --
   procedure Put (P : in Param_S);

   function Get(N_Modulations : in Integer) return Param_S;

   --
   -- from a file -- name of file executable
   --
   procedure Save (P : in Param_S);

   procedure Load (P : in out Param_S);

Requires an Ada compiler such as the GNAT IDE -- download community edition from https://www.adacore.com/download/ and select the install for your operating system

Load the project file (such as LTE.gpr) into GNATStudio and select build from the menu. The compiled executable is located in an obj subdirectory.  The obj subdirectory may need to be created before compiling, run the executable from the root directory, i.e. 

> obj/enso_opt
